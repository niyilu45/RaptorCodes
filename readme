"draft" python code exploring rateless erasure codes. 

encoding: 
- Random binary LT codes, 

decoding: 
- gaussian elimination 
- BP decoding

todo:
- LT code with robust soliton distribution
- "Raptorized" version  with LDPC + Hamming for precodes
- R10 distribution

requires numpy and bitarray modules. 

numpy is kind of a nightmare, and i probably wouldnt use it again/might get
rid of it if i keep working on this code.
